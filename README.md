# Wheat-Disease-Detection
A deep learning–based image classification system that detects wheat crop diseases from leaf images using CNN models. The project supports early disease identification to improve crop yield and assist farmers with timely interventions.
# Project Overview
Wheat diseases can severely affect agricultural productivity if not detected early. This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify wheat leaf images into healthy or diseased categories and provides predictions through a **Flask-based web application**.
# Key Features
- Image-based wheat disease classification  
- CNN model for accurate prediction  
- Flask web application interface  
- User-friendly design  
- Supports early detection and intervention  
# Tech Stack
Programming Language:Python  
Deep Learning:TensorFlow, Keras  
Web Framework:Flask  
Image Processing:OpenCV, Pillow  
Frontend:HTML, CSS  
# Dataset
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository.
The dataset is from Kaggle.
# Model Details
- CNN-based deep learning model  
- Trained using labeled wheat leaf images  
- Model file (`.h5`) is excluded due to GitHub size limits  
- Users can retrain the model or load their own trained model
# Use Cases
Assists farmers in early disease detection,
Reduces crop loss through timely intervention,
Supports precision agriculture
# Future Enhancements
